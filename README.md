# Corsair-Keyboard-Leds-Sleep-Timer

A simple sleep timer for Corsair keyboards since there is no option to do so in ICUE software, currently working with static colors and current ICUE profile

Tested on RGB and non-RGB Corsair K70 keyboards, should work on most of Corsair keyboards that are supported with ICUE without any issue
