# Corsair-Keyboard-Leds-Sleep-Timer

A simple sleep timer for Corsair keyboards since there is no option to do so in ICUE software, currently working with static colors

Tested on RGB and non-RGB Corsair K70 keyboards, should work on most of Corsair keyboards that are supported with ICUE without any issue
