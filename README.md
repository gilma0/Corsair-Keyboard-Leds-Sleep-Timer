# Corsair-Keyboard-Leds-Sleep-Timer

A simple sleep timer for Corsair keyboards since there is no option to do so in ICUE software, currently working with static colors and current ICUE profile (current ICUE profile affects ALL ICUE devices!)


Requirments: Corsair ICUE software


Tested on RGB and non-RGB Corsair K70 keyboards, should work on most of Corsair keyboards that are supported with ICUE without any issue

* New versions of ICUE require to enable software integrations in the settings
