# Corsair-Keyboard-Leds-Sleep-Timer

A simple sleep timer for Corsair keyboards since there is no option to do so in ICUE software

Tested on Corsair K70 keyboard, should work on other Corsair keyboards but may require minor changes

input_based: Detects key presses and mouse movements, issue with detecting inputs in some apps

idle_based: Uses ctype to measure idle time, works everywhere (as far as i know), simpler and works better

Made specifically for non rgb models

Requirments: Corsair ICUE software
